Note: Your dataset is probably naturally either a regression problem or a classification problem. So either this homework or the next homework (Classification) will feel very forced. State this explicitely in the answer for Question 3.

1.  Identify a data set from Applied Predictive Models (APM) Chapter 1.4.
2.  Identify a variable that you will attempt to predict using regression.
    i. Name
    ii. Short, one sentence description
    iii. Description of potential values (include data type and units)
    iv. mean, median, quartiles, range if applicable
    v. histogram/density plot
3.  A hypothetical CoNVO statement.  Note: if this is not the natural problem setting that you identified in homework 1 (i.e. you really have a classification problem), state this. Your CoNVO statement for this assignment can potentially be very unrealistic in this case.
4.  For Recursive Partitioning (CART) and one of:

    1.  Linear regression,
    2.  Lasso
    3.  Ridge regresssion

      use 10 fold cross validation to:

        1.  Determine the correct complexity of the model.
        2.  Compare each using Root mean square error.

5.  Repeat (4) using two of the following:
    1.  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    2.  Neural Nets
    3.  Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
    4.  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    5.  Random forests
    6.  Boosting
    7.  Cubist

6.  Reflection.  Which method (of the four you used) is the best for this problem and why.
