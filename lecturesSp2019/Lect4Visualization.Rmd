Scoping problems
===================
type: section

Projects
========

-  Look at Kaggle for ideas.
-  If you have a project from another source (another class, project with another professor, thesis topic exploration, etc.) ask me about using it for this project.

Representing data
=================
type: section

Snow data
========

- If you were responsible for winter snow removal preparation, What would you like to know about the coming year's snow forecast?


What is visualization for?
==========================

-  Analysis and exploration
-  Communicate and present information
-  Entertainment
-  Art

Visualizations in data science
==============================



How do we represent data?
=========================

-  Use visual cues to show values.
-  Shapes, colors, scales, position.
-  Visualization is how we summarize raw data to communicate meaning.
-  What makes for a good visualization?


Visualization components
========================
type: section

Visualization components
========================

.
![Visualization components](resources/visualizationcomponents.jpg)


Visual cues
===========

.
![Visual cues](../resources/visualcues.jpg)

Ranking visual cues
===================

Some visual cues are more clear than others

![Ranking visual cues](../resources/visualcuesranked.jpg)

Coordinate systems
==================

Coordinate systems dictate the dimensions of the visualization.

.
![Coordinate systems](../resources/coordinatesystems.jpg)

Scales
======

Scales dictate where in the dimensions the data maps to.

.

Using visualization
===================
type:section


Data exploration questions to ask?
==================================

-  What data do you have?
-  What do you want to know about your data?
-  Which visualization methods should you use?
-  What do you see and does it make sense?

Exploring through visualization
===============================

![Data exploration](../resources/visualizationexploration.jpg)

Visualizing categorical data
============================

.

Time
====

Time is continuous, but you can also divide it into categories.

![Time](../resources/visualizationtime.jpg)


Time series
===========

How does your data change over time?

.
![Time series](../resources/visualizationtimeseries.jpg)

Visualizing spatial data
========================

.
![Time series](../resources/visualizationspatial.jpg)

Combining components
====================

By combining components, graphs are richer and can display many relationships at once.

.
![Combining components](../resources/visualcombinations.jpg)


Multiple variables
==================

There is no hard limit to how many variables can be in one visualization

.
![Multiple views](../resources/visualizationmultiple.jpg)

Data distribution
=================

- Visualization can show how data is distributed in a population
- Box plots
- Histograms
- Density plots

Visualizing distributions
=========================

.
![Distributions](../resources/visualizationdistributions.jpg)


Comparisons
===========

One thing that visualizations should do is show how things change.

.
![Comparisons](../resources/visualcomparisons.jpg)

Color scales
============

-  Sequential
-  Diverging
-  Qualitative

![Colorscales](../resources/visualizationcolorscales.jpg)


Highlighting
============

Emphasize a particular data point or series to place focus

![Highlighting](../resources/visualizationhighlighting.jpg)

Annotation
==========

Give context to data or explain boundary cases.

.
![Annotation example](../resources/visualannotations.jpg)

Making things pretty
====================

Summary
=======

-  Think in terms of telling a story.
-  What is the message?
-  What is the main point?
-  How to tell it?
