Data sets
---------

-  Quandl.  Many time series datasets with an R package to interface with the API.  Registration not strictly required, but it will make exploring data much easier without the limits you run into without registration.
http://www.quandl.com/

-  Data.gov  Data sources collected by U.S. government agencies. Pick an interest, there is something here. The only question is if it has been aggregated or not (you want as disaggregated as possible)
http://www.data.gov/

-  U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Sample.  This is the detailed (long form) version of the census that is given to a small percentage of the population.  It is very detailed and extensive.

  -  Subjects covered http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/data_documentation/pums/SubjectsinPUMS/Subjects_2007_2011PUMS.pdf

-  CDC National Vital Statistics System.  Birth and mortality data.  Everyone from 2000 is represented here.

-  Mine Safety and Health Administration. Data sets on accident reports, coal dust samples, employment and production.

-  National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD).
	- in 2012, more than one quarter of the united states population lived in the jurisdiction of a police department that submitted details about every crime to a central repository maintained by the fbi.  a production of the uniform crime reports (ucr) program, the national incident-based reporting system (nibrs) compiles statistics from police agencies in thirty five states plus dc.  if you are just looking for general crime counts, those justice statisticians might have already tabulated your number here.  but for the more discriminating criminal behavior aficionado, the university of michigan's inter-university consortium for political and social research (icpsr) maintains every microdata extract of criminal events, offense types, victims, and arrestees as far back as the first bush administration in its national archive of criminal justice data (nacjd).
