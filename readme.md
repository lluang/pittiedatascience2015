# IE 2064:  Data Science – Spring 2015

- Time:  Tue  5:20 - 7:50
- Place:  1020 Benedum Hall
- Instructor:  Dr. Louis Luangkesorn

## Description

Data science covers methods for collecting, preparing, analyzing, and visualizing large collections of information.  This course will cover aspects of descriptive and predictive analytics, starting with obtaining and processing data from published and online sources and moving to descriptive and predictive analytics. Topics will include:  working with data, organizing data, summarizing data, sampling data, working with web based API for accessing data, statistical analysis of data, working with text, combining data sets, identifying relationships between data sets, data mining, and reporting.  The focus is on understanding and applying methods on real data over mathematical rigor.  The course will use R for data preparation, data analysis, model development, and interpreting results.

Note:  Students should work through the tutorial An Introduction to R (listed as supplement) prior to the beginning of the course.

## Supplements

-  Bill Venables, David Smith, and the R Core Team, (2013), An Introduction to R - Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics, available at http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html and distributed along with R

-  Hadley Wickham, (2009), ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, Springer, ISBN: 0387981403.  You only need Chapter 2: Getting started with ggplot which is available at the book website.  http://ggplot2.org/book/

## Software tools

### R

- R environment for statistical computing. http://cran.r-project.org. The easiest way to get is is through through Revolution Analytics http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/downloads/

- Various libraries. Easiest way to install them is to install the library that comes with Data Mining with R and Rattle, a R interface used in data mining. In R enter:

    install.packages(c("DMwR", "rattle"), dependencies = c("Depends", "Suggests"))

    R will install all the associated libraries automatically. This will take a few minutes as Rattle is a very full featured data mining application.

###  R Studio

-	R Studio Integrated Development Environment.

    http://www.rstudio.com/ide/ Install this after installing R. Includes knitr and R Markdown for reporting.

###  Git Version Control


-  Bitbucket sourcecode repository.
http://bitbucket.org

-  Git Distributed Version Control System
http://git-scm.com/

-  If you are using Windows or Mac, get Sourcetree

    http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/


##  Prerequisites:

- Probability and statistics
- Computer programming.
- Familiarity with R. While one does not have to be an R programmer at any level of skill, you should have installed R and R Studio and worked through An Introduction to R prior to the beginning of the course.  Instructions on obtaining and installing R and R Studio are at http://cran.r-project.org and http://rstudio.org.  In addition, Introduction to Data Science has a chapter introducing each.
