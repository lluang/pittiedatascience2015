Note: Your dataset from EDA is probably naturally either a regression problem or a classification problem.  So you do not necessarily need to use the same dataset for this assignment as the EDA dataset if it is unrealistic for a regression problem.

1.  Identify a data set from Applied Predictive Models (APM) Chapter 1.4 or from the book website. (may be same as homework 1)
2.  Identify a variable that you will attempt to predict using regression.
    i. Name
    ii. Short, one sentence description
    iii. Description of potential values (include data type and units)
    iv. mean, median, quartiles, range if applicable
    v. histogram/density plot
3.  A hypothetical CoNVO statement that identifies a potential client, with context and need. .  
4.  Use 10 fold cross validation with one model from each of the following categories to:

        1.  Determine the correct complexity of the model.
        2.  Compare each using Root mean square error.
    i.  Linear modes
        1.  Linear regression,
        2.  Lasso
        3.  Ridge regresssion
    ii.  Trees
        1.  Regression tree
    iv. Non-linear models
        1.  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        2.  Neural Nets
        3.  Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
        4.  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    v. Ensemble methods
        1.  Random forests
        2.  Boosting
        3.  Cubist

5.  Present the results as if you were going present this to the hypothetical client (vision). How would the client react (outcome)?

6.  Reflection.  Which category (of the four you used) is the best for this problem and why.
