Note: Your dataset from EDA is probably naturally either a regression problem or a classification problem.  So you do not necessarily need to use the same dataset for this assignment as the EDA dataset.

1.  Identify a data set from Applied Predictive Models (APM) Chapter 1.4.
2.  Identify a variable that you will attempt to predict using classification
    i. Name
    ii. Short, one sentence description
    iii. Description of potential values (include data type and units)
    iv. Histogram plot
3.  A hypothetical CoNVO statement.  Note: if this is not the natural problem setting that you identified in homework 1 (i.e. you really have a classification problem), state this. Your CoNVO statement for this assignment can potentially be very unrealistic in this case.
4.  For Classification trees and one of:

    1.  Logistic regression,
    2.  Linear discriminant analysis
    3.  Partial least squares discriminant analysis
    4.  Penalized models

      use 10 fold cross validation to:

        1.  Determine the correct complexity of the model.
        2.  Compare each showing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for that model and AUC.
        3.  Construct a lift chart.

5.  Repeat (4) using two of the following:
    1.  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    2.  Neural Nets
    3.  Non-linear discriminant analysis
    4.  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    5.  Random forests
    6.  Boosting
    7.  Cubist
    8.  Naive Bayes

6.  Reflection.  Which method (of the four you used) is the best for this problem and why.
